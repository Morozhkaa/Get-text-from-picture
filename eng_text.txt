hey you.

yes, you. stop being unhappy with yourself. you are perfect.
stop wishing you looked like someone else or wishing people
liked you as much as they like someone else. stop trying to get
attention from those who hurt you. stop hating your body, your
face, your personality, your quirks. love them. without those
things you wouldn’t be you. and why would you want to be
anyone else? be confident with who you are. smile. it’ll draw
people in. if anyone hates on you because you are happy with
yourself then you stick your middle finger in the air and say
screw it. my happiness will not depend on others anymore.
i’m happy because i love who i am. i love my flaws. i love my
imperfections. they make me me. and ‘me’ is pretty amazing.
